# ShapTime
A paper that has been submitted to IJCAI.
The core of the work is to build the general explainable method specifically for time series forecasting.
The focus is on explaining the importance of time itself, so that the forecasting performance can be improved based on that.

Boosting and RNN models are used in time series forecasting tasks

Since IJCAI adopts the double-blind review mechanism, more detailed descriptions need to wait for the feedback from IJCAI.
